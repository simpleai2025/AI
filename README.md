# SimpleAI  

## Getting Started  
Before contributing, please make sure to read all the guidelines carefully!  

## Description  
**SimpleAI** is an open-source project where anyone can contribute to building a platform that helps people explore the world of Artificial Intelligence.  

In SimpleAI, users can access a variety of AI-related algorithms. For each algorithm, there will also be a dedicated file containing useful information. This way, users can not only study the code but also better understand how it works.  

Each file may include:  
- Descriptions  
- Illustrations or images  
- Links to resources  
- Any other material that facilitates learning  

Our main goal is **simplicity**: even beginners who have just developed an interest in AI should be able to learn the basics and gradually deepen their knowledge.  

Nowadays, the internet is full of scattered resources on technology. The purpose of SimpleAI is to provide a **clear and reliable source**, avoiding the information overload that often makes learning overwhelming.  

## How to Contribute  
As mentioned, **anyone** can contribute to the project!  

Ways you can help:  
- Upload your code (preferably in Python) along with an explanatory file.  
- Write explanatory files about AI-related topics, even if you’re not coding.  
- Suggest edits, improvements, or fixes to existing content.  
- Spot and correct mistakes (logical, functional, grammatical, etc.).  

When contributing code:  
- Add comments to help others understand your work.  
- There are no strict coding standards—what matters is clarity and correctness.  
- **Simplicity > efficiency**: the goal is learning, not optimization.  

No contribution is too small—everything helps!  

## Who We Are  
SimpleAI was launched by a small group of computer science students who recently started exploring Artificial Intelligence.  

We want to build a supportive community that shares knowledge and grows together.  

- We welcome anyone who wants to join the project.  
- We are not experts—just learners, like many of you.  
- Some files may contain mistakes, and that’s okay!  

That’s why it’s important to always give feedback with **kindness and respect**, whether pointing out an error or suggesting improvements.
